# 1.2.2 What's an HTTP?

**🎥 Video Resource:** [What is HTTP?](https://youtube.com/shorts/UtUAwxe-Qp8?si=dUsi_x9O5hSpExKa) (A quick overview)

**HTTP** stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**.

* **Definition:** It is an **Application Layer Protocol** used for transmitting hypertext and other information between a **Client** (e.g., a web browser) and a **Server**.
* **Foundation of the Web:** HTTP is the primary protocol that powers the World Wide Web, defining the format for request and response messages.
* **Stateless:** HTTP is inherently **stateless**, meaning the server does not retain any information (state) about past client requests. Every request is treated as independent. (Session management methods are used to overcome this limitation).
* **HTTPS:** This is the secure version of HTTP. The 'S' stands for **Secure**, indicating that communication is encrypted using **TLS/SSL**.
