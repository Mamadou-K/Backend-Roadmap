A **Web Browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) is an application that allows users to access and view information on the World Wide Web.

* **Definition:** It acts as the **Client** in the Request-Response cycle, initiating communication with web servers.
* **Primary Role:** Its main job is to interpret the data (primarily HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) it receives from a server and display it as a visually rendered webpage for the user.
* **Key Components:**
    * **User Interface (UI):** The address bar, back/forward buttons, etc.
    * **Browser Engine:** Manages the actions between the UI and the rendering engine.
    * **Rendering Engine (Layout Engine):** Interprets HTML/CSS and draws the content on the screen.
    * **JavaScript Engine:** Executes JavaScript code (critical for modern interactive websites).
