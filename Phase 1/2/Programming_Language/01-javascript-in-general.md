**🎥 Video Resource (Overview):** [What is JavaScript? (in 100 seconds)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE)

**JavaScript (JS)** is the cornerstone of modern web development. While historically known as the language of web browsers (frontend), its adoption by **Node.js** has made it a powerful and dominant choice for **backend development**.

* **Versatility:** JS is the only language that can run natively across the entire stack: frontend (in the browser), backend (via Node.js), and even mobile (via React Native/Flutter).
* **Asynchronous Nature:** JS is single-threaded but excels at handling high concurrency due to its **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**, which is ideal for I/O-heavy tasks like web servers.
* **Ecosystem:** It boasts the world's largest package repository, **npm (Node Package Manager)**, providing access to millions of reusable libraries and tools.
